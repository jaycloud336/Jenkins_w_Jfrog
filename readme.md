# JFrog CLI and Jenkins Pipeline Integration

This guide demonstrates how to set up JFrog Artifactory with Jenkins, using the JFrog CLI to automate artifact management and CI/CD pipelines. The steps include setting up JFrog repositories, configuring Jenkins credentials, creating a pipeline in Jenkins to interact with Artifactory, and running the pipeline to upload, promote, and download artifacts. The example pipeline script shows how to integrate JFrog CLI commands within Jenkins, including version checks, file uploads, and build promotions. For more details, refer to the [JFrog Documentation](https://jfrog.com/help/r/artifactory-how-to-use-jfrog-cli-in-jenkins-using-jfrog-plugin/review-a-sample-cli-project) and the [Jfrog command cheat sheet](https://media.jfrog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/04103525/JFrogCLI_CheatSheet-v2.pdf).
